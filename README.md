Nana

A simple large-type app for composing emails, written for my dyslexic Nana.

It uses an easy-to-read [white-on-black style](www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html), and a dyslexia-friendly font called [Open Dyslexic](https://github.com/ultimateboro/open-dyslexic/).

It also helps hide the clutter involved in replying to emails (the replying-to text is hidden), allowing for less chance of getting lost in an email thread.

Feel free to use the code, it's basically just a full-screen dyslexia-friendly letter composer.
